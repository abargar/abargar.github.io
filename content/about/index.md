Howdy! I'm Alicia, a senior software developer based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. I'm originally from the United States, where I lived everywhere from rural South Carolina to New York City.

In my career, I have built analytic platforms and software that support research in cybersecurity, social media, and social network analysis. As of July 2021, I have been working at Shopify as a senior data developer on the machine learning platform team. 

Outside of work, I enjoy reading everything from mysteries to economic theory, writing, and coming up with new artsy/tech projects. I can often be found bouldering, cooking, or exploring my newest home city with friends.
