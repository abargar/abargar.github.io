Howdy! I'm Alicia, a senior software developer based in the Netherlands. I'm from the United States where I lived everywhere from rural Virginia and South Carolina to Los Angeles and New York City. 

In my career, I have built analytic platforms and software that support research in cybersecurity, social media, and social network analysis. As of July 2021, I have been working at Shopify as a senior data developer on the machine learning platform team. 

Outside of work, I enjoy reading everything from mysteries and popular science to economic theory, and coming up with new artsy/tech projects. When there is not a worldwide pandemic, I also enjoy dancing, traveling, and volunteering with animals.
