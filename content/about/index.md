Howdy! I'm Alicia, a senior software developer based in the Netherlands. I'm from the United States and have lived everywhere from rural Virginia and South Carolina to Los Angeles and New York City.

In previous careers, I have built analytic platforms and software that support research in cybersecurity, social media, and social network analysis. As of July 2021, I've taken a social media detox break and I now work at Shopify as a senior developer. This career meshes nicely with my two personal passions: supporting local businesses and organizations, and learning about the variety of lived experiences people have both here in the U.S. and in other countries.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading everything from mysteries and popular science to economic theory, and coming up with new artsy/tech projects. When there is not a worldwide pandemic, I also enjoy dancing, traveling, and volunteering with animals.
