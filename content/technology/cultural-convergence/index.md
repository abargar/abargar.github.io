How can the birth and evolution of ideas and communities in a network
be studied over time? We use a multimodal pipeline, consisting of network map-
ping, topic modeling, bridging centrality, and divergence to analyze Twitter data
surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. We use network mapping to detect ac-
counts creating content surrounding COVID-19, then Latent Dirichlet Allocation
to extract topics, and bridging centrality to identify topical and non-topical
bridges, before examining the distribution of each topic and bridge over time and
applying Jensen-Shannon divergence of topic distributions to show communities
that are converging in their topical narratives.
