Nation-states and multilateral organizations continue to face challenges
while attempting to counter false narratives, due to lack of familiarity and experience
with online environments, limited knowledge and theory of human interaction with
and within these spaces, and the limitations imposed by those who own and maintain
social media platforms. In particular, these attributes present unique difficulties for
the identification and attribution of campaigns, tracing information flows at scale, and
identifying spheres of influence. 


We propose that the use of social network analysis (SNA) can aid in addressing some
of these challenges. We begin by providing a brief explanation of the field and its
utility in understanding online communications. Specifically, we focus on how 
current research in social influence, information diffusion, and cluster
analysis can be immediately applied and identify opportunities for future research.
We demonstrate how these analytic techniques can work in practice on example datasets. 

We conclude by discussing how the use of these methods can lead to the development of tactical 
approaches countering misinformation campaigns.
