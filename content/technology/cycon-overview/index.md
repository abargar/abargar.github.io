Information operations on social media have recently attracted the attention
of media outlets, research organizations and governments, given the proliferation of
high-profile cases such as the alleged foreign interference in the 2016 US presidential
election. Nation-states and multilateral organizations continue to face challenges
while attempting to counter false narratives, due to lack of familiarity and experience
with online environments, limited knowledge and theory of human interaction with
and within these spaces, and the limitations imposed by those who own and maintain
social media platforms. In particular, these attributes present unique difficulties for
the identification and attribution of campaigns, tracing information flows at scale, and
identifying spheres of influence. Complications include the anonymity and competing
motivations of online actors, poorly understood platform dynamics, and the sparsity
of information regarding message transferal across communication platforms.
We propose that the use of social network analysis (SNA) can aid in addressing some
of these challenges. We begin by providing a brief explanation of the field and its
utility in understanding online communications. We discuss how theories drawn from
SNA, which seek to make statistical inferences about relationships and information
transfer, can be applied to the information operations domain. Specifically, we will
focus on how current research in social influence, information diffusion, and cluster
analysis can be immediately applied and identify opportunities for future research.
We then demonstrate how these analytic techniques can work in practice, utilizing
multiple online communication datasets. Finally, we conclude by discussing how the
use of these methods can lead to the development of tactical approaches countering
misinformation campaigns.
