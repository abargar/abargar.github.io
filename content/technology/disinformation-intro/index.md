"Fake news!" is such a common term nowadays that it's a joke. Misinformation and disinformation not so much, though the news like to bring them up. My goal here is to explain what disinformation is, who's doing it and why. That way you can better track what people are saying about and understand if disinformation is something you should be concerned about. Also, some of these case studies are crazy so I frankly just want to share them with you.

Without further ado, let's get started!

## What is Disinformation?
**Fake news** used to mean news that are factually wrong. Now people use it however they want. As a term, it's basically meaningless now.

Have you ever had someone tell you something they thought was true, so you believed it, but then they were totally wrong? That's **misinformation**. It can be confusing and a bummer, but it's usually not a crime.

**Disinformation**  isn't just "someone got it wrong" territory, this is "false information _deliberately_ and often _covertly_ spread... in order to influence public opinion or obscure the truth" (Merriam-Webster, emphasis added). If misinformation is your best friend accidentally giving you bad information, disinformation is the evil teenage girl who starts rumors to ruin your life.

![Mean girls reference: "I know, right?"](https://tenor.com/view/i-know-right-mean-girls-i-know-right-regina-george-gif-5125240.gif)

Disinformation has existed for as long as people have used communication and deceit to bring down their foes. However, the introduction of the Internet and online social forums has enabled lies and rumors to spread more quickly and to more people than ever before.

## Who creates disinformation?

It's not just Russia, even though their use of this strategy is [very well-documented](https://secondaryinfektion.org/). In fact, [Oxford documents 81 countries](https://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/posts/industrialized-disinformation/) that generate disinformation either for their citizens or directed at other countries.  Governments want to influence people to support their policies and to dislike whoever the government considers an enemy. In this way, disinformation is basically a form of propaganda. Some examples of state-sponsored campaigns around the world include [Iran](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/05/social-media-network-impersonates-us-political-candidates-supports-iranian-interests.html), [the Philippines](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/03/802392333/a-thousand-cuts-documentary-tracks-disinformation-in-dutertes-philippines?t=1640780382853), and [Syria](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/syria-white-helmets-conspiracy-theories).

![But wait there's more](https://tenor.com/view/oxi-clean-but-wait-theres-more-home-shopping-gif-9592017.gif)

Companies now exist to provide disinformation as a service. The cybersecurity firm Recorded Future investigated [disinformation hiring services on the dark market](https://www.recordedfuture.com/disinformation-service-campaigns/) and for only a few thousand dollars a month were able to contract two different groups for the same fictitious company. The Organized Crime and Corruption Project also led an undercover investigation to discover the inner workings of [a Ukrainian troll farm](https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/inside-a-ukrainian-troll-farm) hired to support local political campaigns.


This isn't even limited to countries and companies. Sometimes groups of like-minded people, friends, or even individuals will spin up campaigns to purposefully manipulate people. People on the [4chan](https://erin-gallagher.medium.com/alt-right-culture-jamming-and-memetic-warfare-93b646263f7d) forum created propaganda materials and ran disinformation campaigns together apparently for fun. [This guy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/nothing-on-this-page-is-real-how-lies-become-truth-in-online-america/2018/11/17/edd44cc8-e85a-11e8-bbdb-72fdbf9d4fed_story.html) created a 'political satire' Facebook group, where he tricks people with fake content and then makes fun of them. Unsurprisingly, as the Washington Post notes, this ends up looking more like disinformation as it polarizes people and makes them susceptible to other fake ideas.

## Why do they do it?

Sometimes because they're mean. But people run disinformation campaigns for other reasons than earning money or being jerks.  Let's focus on those.

#### 1.  To get their candidate elected

In an interview with Bloomberg, a hacker discussed [his work for multiple political campaigns](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-how-to-hack-an-election/) throughout Latin America, where he set up fake accounts and organized social media trends that would damage their opponents. However, even small elections can be impacted. A candidate running for a position on a local US hospital board  hired the Israeli firm Psy-Group to create and run ["a coordinated intelligence operation and influence campaign”](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/18/private-mossad-for-hire) (New Yorker). 

#### 2. Get good press, lose bad press

 The volunteer organization the White Helmets drew ire from Syrian and Russian authorities due to their documentation of the fallout of military attacks on civilians. [Multiple disinformation campaigns have since sprung up on social media](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/syria-white-helmets-conspiracy-theories), either comparing them to actors and saying they fake their rescues or else stating that they are actually a terrorist organization. In the Philippines, [President Duterte has also used disinformation](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/03/802392333/a-thousand-cuts-documentary-tracks-disinformation-in-dutertes-philippines) as one of his tools to sow doubt about critics and independent news media.

 #### 3. To tear a group apart.

 In the last scene of _The Dark Knight_, the Joker puts bombs on two ships - one with prisoners, one with normal civilians - and gives each ship the trigger to the other bomb. He thought that they would be fearful and distrusting enough that at least one group would pull the trigger. Even without pulling the trigger, the Joker would win because his goal was to achieve mayhem, violence, and distrust. 

![Joker and here we go gif](https://tenor.com/view/joker-the-dark-knight-here-we-go-the-joker-gif-15343519.gif)

 Imagine if he had imposters in both groups pointing out all the reasons they shouldn't trust the other ship. Or, better yet, if he had been priming them over months or years to believe the other group would hurt them. Would they still have enough faith in humanity to abstain from the trigger?

The best documented example of this is the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) in the United States. [They organized protests](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/01/25/russians-got-tens-of-thousands-of-americans-to-rsvp-for-their-phony-political-events-on-facebook/?hpid=hp_no-name_no-name%3Apage%2Fbreaking-news-bar) on Facebook for people with opposite views (e.g. anti-Muslim and pro-Muslim) to take place at the same time and place. They worked to stoke both [racial](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-ira-target-black-americans/) and [political](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/12/16/new-report-russian-disinformation-prepared-senate-shows-operations-scale-sweep/) tensions prior to the 2016 election, and [online campaigns were again uncovered](https://www.graphika.com/reports/step-into-my-parler/) prior to the election in 2020.

#### 4. To counter other disinformation campaigns (?!)

The first example of this case was discovered just recently at the end of 2020. A [French-sponsored disinformation campaign](https://www.graphika.com/reports/more-troll-kombat/) was detected in various African countries, seemingly in response to a Russian-sponsored campaign in the same territories. The two groups faced off via social media accounts which they used to share information, comment and DM each other, and discredit the other campaign's information as "fake news." 

![Two spidermans point at each other meme](https://tenor.com/view/two-spiderman-pointing-meme-gif-11796793.gif)

As the linked report notes, though, there are some serious ethical complications around trying to fight disinformation by creating your own. 

> By creating fake accounts and fake “anti-fake-news” pages to combat the trolls, the French operators were perpetuating and implicitly justifying the problematic behavior they were trying to fight. (Graphika)

## How do I learn more?

Here are some people and places I recommend :

### Companies

* [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/) does fantastic open-source investigations.

* [Graphika](https://www.graphika.com/reports/) has case studies covering a lot of places and detailed analyses (full disclosure - I used to work here). [Camille Francois](https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/cfrancois) started the intel team and is an excellent person to follow on Twitter for the latest updates. 

* [DFRLab](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/digital-forensic-research-lab/)  maintain an active [Medium account](https://medium.com/dfrlab) where they post ongoing reports.

### Labs and Universities

* [Kate Starbird](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/starbird) and the [crew](https://www.cip.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington are awesome. 

* The [Programme on Democracy and Technology (previously the Oxford Computational Propaganda Project)](https://demtech.oii.ox.ac.uk/) has been doing work in this space for a long time.

* The [Stanford Internet Observatory](https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/io) is constantly putting out reports. [Renee DiResta](http://www.reneediresta.com/) is the research manager there.

* The [iDrama Lab](https://idrama.science/)'s focus is more on harassment campaigns and radicalization, but there's an overlap and  their work is interesting and insightful.

I am 100% forgetting great people so... in lieu of that, here's some books and movies that are great at covering this general territory. Also, please note that this list is continually changing and updating as people enter and grow in the field.
